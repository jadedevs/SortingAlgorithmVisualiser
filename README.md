# SortingAlgorithmVisualiser
A small project that I put together to visualise the processes of four sorting algorithms on a small set of data.

---

## Includes the following algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort

---

## Usage
The program is relatively simple to use, just run "construct.py", ensuring that "sorts.py" is in the same directory. This can be done in any environment, as it opens a separate GUI window.

It is unlikely that you'll find any use in this program, I just made it to educate myself a little on these algorithms ;D
